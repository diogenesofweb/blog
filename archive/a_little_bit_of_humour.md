### Future hit song (MIT licence), early WIP:

Baby, baby, baby foo!\
Baby, baby, baby bar!

When I look at your gorgeous ass\
I realise how small is my bundle dot JS\
Even though I use Angular with Firestore\
You overshadow them like never before

Baby, baby, baby foo!\
Baby, baby, baby bar!

**MongoBD**: "What's best programming language to learn for new developers?"

**Devs**: "SQL, obviously ðŸ˜‰ !!!"

### git commit -m :

Ready or not, here I com...mit\
Gonna find you and merge it slowly\
(You canâ€™t hide, gonna find youâ€¦ in Github)

### Big Black Hole :

I heard her singing

> There's a big black hole where my heart used to be\
> And I tried my best to fill it up with things I don't need

She obviously doesn't know about **NPM**.

There is no hole big enough that `node_modules` couldn't fill.
